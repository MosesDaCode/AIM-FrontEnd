            Let's dive into the meaning of the name{" "}
            <em>Arameans In Medicine</em> and what issues precaused the startup
            of the organisation. "Medicine" is defined as the science of health
            and healing. The <em>World Health Organisation</em> defines health
            as{" "}
            <strong>
              "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and
              not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."
            </strong>{" "}
            Collaboration and cooperation among various actors, organizations,
            and levels are crucial aspects that run through the entire
            healthcare system. This concerns vocations such as{" "}

          <p>
            The "Arameans" are indigenous people of The Middle
            East(Mesopotamia), mentioned since over 3000 yrs ago and the biggest
            semitic ethnic group ever existed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today Arameans are dispersed in a global diaspora due to centuries
            of persecution in their homeland, and due to the world map drawing
            excluding Arameans from the right to their own lands, which they
            still inhabitate until today. The name Aramean is the original
            ethnic name of the people who lived in several city-states in
            Middle-East, mainly in Mesopotamia. The Arameans have at times been
            ruled by other nations in history such as the Assyrians and
            Babylonians but however remained the vast majority of the
            inhabitants in those areas while under foreign rule. The Arameans
            kept their Aramean names and culture and thus preserved their
            identity despite being occupied by foreign rule. The nations who
            occupied the Aramean lands later came to fall and seized to exist
            while the Aramean prevailed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Arameans were among the 1st nations to adopt Christianity, and
            it remains the biggest religion practised by them, next to Mandaeism
            and Islam. With the Christianisation, the name Syriac or Syrian
            Aramean (not to be limited to and confused with modern day Syria)
            gained popularity amongst Christian Arameans for the distinction
            from Non-Christian Arameans and remains a synonym for Christian
            Arameans yet today.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fast forward a couple of thousand years, The Aramean Christians
            faced ecclesiastical division, adopting new names (some which
            already belonged to pre-existing extinct ethnic nations in history,
            and is not to be confused ethnically with them). Today the Arameans
            go under the following names:{" "}
            <strong>
              Syriac, Maronite, Chaldean, Assyrian, Melkite and Mandean
            </strong>
            .
          </p>

          <p>
            Arameans speak the language that Jesus spoke, yet their language is
            on the verge of extinction today. Arameans don't have a state of
            their own to stand up for their rights or speak up for them.
            Resulting in the need of organisation to protect them and help fight
            their extinction. Arameans don't have the same access to public
            health knowledge in the diaspora as in their homeland due to
            linguistic, cultural and socioeconomic barriers. In the homeland the
            barrier is unfortunatelly often poor economic status and racial
            discrimination. Aramean students in the Medical fields need guidance
            and the professionels a forum to grow.
          </p>

          <p>
            Arameans in Medicine aims to gather medical professionals and
            students for the cause of helping the Aramean community world wide
            from a health care point of view. The organisation{" "}
            <strong>
              welcomes everyone in the community outside of the medical and
              health care industry
            </strong>{" "}
            to become a benefitting member and supporter, no matter occupation.
          </p>

          <h3>Christians of Middle East</h3>

          <p>
            Such as Armenian and Coptic brothers and sisters have a long shared
            history of being persecuted for their faith and share similar values
            and struggles in the Middle East. They are warlmy welcomed to join
            the cause and work for shared goals.
